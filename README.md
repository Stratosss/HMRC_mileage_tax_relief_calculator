# HMRC_mileage_tax_relief_calculator
This project focuses on the development of an applicaation to help the users calculate their HMRC tax relief amount stemming from their business mileage for each financial year.
The app assumes that the user is compensated with a standard amount pence/mile by their organisation for the whole financial year.
The user inserts the following values:
- Pence/mile compensation of their company.
- Pence/mile compensation from HMRC for the first 10k miles.
- Pence/mile compensation from HMRC for the rest of the miles.
- Tax band (20% / 40%) of the individual.

Then, the app calculates the amount the user can claim relief on. It also calculates the amount they save based on their tax band. Finally, it copies the tax relief amount to the clipboard for the user to use it in filling their self-assessment forms.
